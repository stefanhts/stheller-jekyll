<p>I’m making a website using a nifty little too called Jekyll that turns .md blog posts into static html which is really quite convenient. I’m doing this as a fun little side project, a way to flex my very atrophied coding muscles and, a way to tell friends and family what is going on in my life.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-will-i-post">How often will I post?</h2>
<p>No idea, depends if I get bored or busy or idk die tragically, I can’t predict the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-goals-here">What are my goals here?</h2>
<p>I want to at least make this site reasonably nice to look at and not exceptionally boring. I’d like to share my interests when it comes to cinema and music and whatever other stuff I can think of.</p>

<p class="image-right">Oh Jeez Rick, its gonna be an interesting journey as Stefan tries to understand the internet. Let’s hope for the best.
