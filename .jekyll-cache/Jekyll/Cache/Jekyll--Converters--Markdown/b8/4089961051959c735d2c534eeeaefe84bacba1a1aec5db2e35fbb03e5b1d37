<p>Somehow I managed to finish my formal lab report, grading all my exams, and itâ€™s not even 2am yet. This is what we call a <b><i>success</i></b> story. This was the 1 and only formal lab report of the semester for me, and I think this might have been the busiest I will be all semester. Hereâ€™s hoping anywayâ€¦</p>

<p>So for an update, I still have a midterm, technically tomorrow, in Economics. I have not studyed at all yet and honestly I donâ€™t plan to study much, but weâ€™ve got a strong 32 hours or so, so the world really is my oyster. What a strange sayingâ€¦</p>

<p>For the rest of the week I will be working on my 9 problems of Quantum Mechanics homework. A little fun tidbit about this one, our professor informed us that 1 of the problems took him, a Ph.d. professional physicist, over 6 hours to complete. So this is going to be an interesting assignment. We also have our first midterm in the class on Monday and itâ€™s going to be a wild ride.</p>

<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth-about-taing">The unfortunate truth about TAing</h2>
<p>Other than the intense anxiety that TAing causes me, itâ€™s not the worst gig, for the most part I can choose my own hours, and work as much or as little as I find necessary. I donâ€™t get paid a lot, but itâ€™s a conviniet job and Iâ€™m not mad at that.</p>

<p>This is where the fun stops though. Not only is grading exams tedious and time consuming, it is extremely disheartening and depressing. A friend recommended I share this, because most people donâ€™t get to see the other side of teaching. I had to give my first failing grade to a student on an exam tonight. It was one of the worst feelings I have experienced. I wanted so much to be able to converse with the student or find some way to fix their grade and make it a little less severe, but the grading is pretty binary, and it would be unfair to other students if I were to change the grading for an individual student.</p>

<p>The entire time I was grading that first failing exam I could tell what was going to happen before I actually did the math on their score. I couldnâ€™t help but imagine myself being the student recieving that grade. I have been there, and the stomach drop is sickening like almost nothing else Iâ€™ve experienced.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m going to adapt to this reality of having to give really horrible grades to good people. I simultaneously hope and fear that it will become easier in the future. Hereâ€™s hoping no one in my class ever fails another exam. That would be the happiest outcome for all of us.</p>

<h3 id="anyway">Anyway</h3>
<p>This hasnâ€™t been a very structured blog. Iâ€™ve kind of just let my stream of conciousness out. I hope this sheds light on what itâ€™s like to be the person doing the grading, but I donâ€™t know. Events like this leave me unsure of my convictions and Iâ€™m going to have to think about this for a while before I know exactly how to feel.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-i-finished-my-work-but-theres-more-obviously-also-grading-is-hard-and-boring-but-also-very-disheartening">TL;DR: I finished my work, but thereâ€™s more obviously. Also grading is hard and boring, but also very disheartening.</h3>
