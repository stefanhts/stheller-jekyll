<p>Another week is ushered in by watching the hours tick away as I sit in the somehow ever crowded study areas of Mckeldin Library. For the uninitiated, Mckeldin is the massive library/study arena where the masses go to pretend to work on homework. In reality most of us are significantly less productive when working in groups in a loud social setting, but don’t tell us that, we might get <span style="color:red">#triggered</span>. I find myself here much too late at night, much too often. I tell myself I’m doing homework, but really I’m writing my notes for tomorrow’s discussion for 20 minutes and then applying for jobs I’ll never get for a couple hours. This continues until I realize how much time has gone by, internally scream in frustration and depressive rage, and then repeat the cycle as I come to grips with the fact that I will never actually get anything done. This is the life of a college student, we get boatloads of homework which take us days to finish, not because they’re that hard, but because we’re that worn out and distracted.

For all of recorded history people have bashed on <span style="color:blue">freshmen</span> for being naive, stupid, scum of the Earth, just the absolute worst, worthless garbage… I could go on. Honestly though, I think the only distinction between <span style="color:blue">freshmen</span> and everyone else is that they haven’t given up yet. God speed young ones, I wish you a swift and painless death of all hope.</p>
