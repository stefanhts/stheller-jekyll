<p>Iâ€™m making a website using a nifty little too called Jekyll that turns .md blog posts into static html which is really quite convenient. Iâ€™m doing this as a fun little side project, a way to flex my very atrophied coding muscles and, a way to tell friends and family what is going on in my life.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-will-i-post">How often will I post?</h2>
<p>No idea depends if I get bored or busy or idk die tragically, I canâ€™t predict the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-goals-here">What are my goals here?</h2>
<p>I want to at least make this site reasonably nice to look at and not exceptionally boring. Iâ€™d like to share my interests when it comes to cinema and music and whatever other stuff I can think of.</p>

<p>Oh, Jeez Rick, itâ€™s going to be an interesting journey as Stefan tries to understand the internet. Letâ€™s hope for the best.</p>
