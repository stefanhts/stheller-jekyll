<p>If I were the one reading this, I would be certain that everything here is made up, but sadly it is not. Shortly after writing yesterdayâ€™s post about how miserable my week had been and how much work I had, it managed to get significantly worse.
Last night I went bowling and had a grand old time. That is, until I went to grab my wallet from the table with all my stuff on it. I realized in that moment that I had gravely miscalculated both the kindness of those around me and my own skills of observation. Sometime during my skillful bowling session someone must have come up behind me and snatched my wallet out from under my nose.
So thatâ€™s where I find myself now. I have no way of paying for anything seeing as I have no cash, no debit card, no credit card, I donâ€™t even have my driverâ€™s license. You really love to see it. The wallet had about $40 in cash, $200 in gift cards and a priceless picture of my mother.
I canceled all of my cards and now I just have to wait until I get new ones and get the time to go to some MVA terminal to get a new license. I could care less about the $40 and the gift cards I would probably have never used, but odds are that Iâ€™ll never get that picture back and now I have to go through the hassle of getting new versions of all my important credentials (ID, insurance card, etc.).
I like to think that I have at least 1 funny line in each post, but for the life of me I canâ€™t find anything funny about this situation. Iâ€™m just fed up and frustrated.
In the end itâ€™s really my fault for being so naive. To quote the great philosopher Kanye West:</p>

<p>I still have not heard back from AWS, still havenâ€™t started my lab report, and Iâ€™m still drowning in work. So yeah, thatâ€™s where I find myself at the current moment.</p>
