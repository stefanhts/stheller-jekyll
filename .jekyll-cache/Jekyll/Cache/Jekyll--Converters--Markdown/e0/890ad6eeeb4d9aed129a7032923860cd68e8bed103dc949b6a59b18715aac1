My name is Stefan T. Heller and this is my website
<br />
I am a physics major at the University of Maryland, College Park
<br />
This website is a side project where I experiment with web-hosting, web-design, and blogging

<h3>Where am I now</h3>
<p>
At the time of writing this I am a 20 year old <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu" style="color:blue;">Physics</a> major at the <a href="https://umd.edu" style="color:red">University of Marlyand, College Park</a>. I am currently taking classes in Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Economics, and Applied Machine Learning while also TAing for Physics 122 and 260, which are non physics major classes. To read more about those head over to my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.

<h3>What are my interests</h3>
<p>
Despite the fact that I'm getting my bachelor's in physics, I have a very wide array of interests. I'm interested in most number and calculation driven disciplines, rangings from physics to data science, computer science, or even economics. I am currently not sure exactly what I want to do as a career. I find myself bouncing between wanting to do something related to data or mathematics, like quantitative research or data analytics, and wanting to do things such as engineering or more experimental research type careers. I am still working my way through the maze of possibilities that is college and have yet to decide firmly on what I want to do.

<p>
When I'm not studying for my classes or preparing lessons for the classes I TA for, I believe it, or not, have other interests. I am very interested in music and movies. I'm currently working on making a section of this site decidated to my favorite music and movies, but for now I have to just leave a teaser. Currently my favorite movie that's come out in the last year is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL4McUzXfFI" style="color:blue;">JoJo Rabbit</a>, and my current favorite album would have to be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Vx9FC6Um8i6kEtY7HNswB?si=4uQ5csLjSLO2B47d6TqgPQ" style="color:green;">Hi This is Flume</a>. Outside of music and movies I find myself either watching a rediculous amount of Youtube, browsing way too much Reddit. When I manage to make myself productive, which is more often than I make it seem, I often find myself in the gym drowning my sorrows and aggression in the monotonous ecstacy of picking up and putting down heavy things.

<h3>That's me</h3>
So that's me summed up pretty well I think. I like numbers, science, and math; I like music and movies: I like Youtube and Reddit; I enjoy picking things up. Stay tuned for more updates and until then feel free to look around my site and judge me as much as you want.
