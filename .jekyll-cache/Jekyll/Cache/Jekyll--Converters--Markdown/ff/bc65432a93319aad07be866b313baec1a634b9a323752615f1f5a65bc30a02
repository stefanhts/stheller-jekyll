<h3> Where am I now?</h3>

<p>At the time of writing this I am 21 and still working on my 2 degress at the
<a href="https://umd.edu" style="color:red">University of Marlyand, College Park</a>.
I am currently taking classes in Computer Systems (gotta love C), Discrete Mathematics, Particle Physics,
and my second course in Quantum mechanics. To read more about what’s going on with me, head over to my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

<h3> What are my interests?</h3>

<p>When I’m not in front of my computer I am… what am I kidding? We’re in the midst of a pandemic, I am only ever in front of my computer.
But while I am in front of my computer, I have an array of interests. I have a passion for music, I have no skill creating it, but I am
really quite good at listening to it. I have a passion for movies, my favorites currently include Bladerunner 2049 and Arrival. Oh, I also
like video games, I’m currently playing a lot of Valorant, Rainbow 6 Siege, and attempting to speedrun Minecraft (it’s not going  well). But
really, I’ll do anything I can to spend time with my friends online, Discord and video games are the only way I’m staying sane during lockdown.
I also enjoy power lifting when I can, I currently have a little set up in my room which allows me to lift without going to the gym, which I
currently cannot because of COVID. I’m thinking I’ll make a post about it soon, but we shall seen.</p>

<h3> So that's me</h3>
<p>Summed up, I like computers, numbers, music, movies, video games, and lifting weights. And yeah that’s all there is to me.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you here more often :)</p>
