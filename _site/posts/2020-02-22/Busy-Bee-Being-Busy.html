<p>I guess I’ll start with what happened last weekend, shortly after making this site I woke up to a phone call from Seattle, Washington, which I ignored of course. Then after checking my email, as one does on a Sunday morning, I realized the call was coming from Amazon Web Services (AWS for short), whom I employ to host this website. It seemed that in my infinite wisdom I had somehow allowed my account to become compromised and there was now someone opening virtual machine computing instances all over the globe. The kind fellow behind this intrusion racked up about $2500 in charges in a couple hours which, as a College Student,<br /> is well within my budget. <span style="color:orange">/s</span> AWS customer support was actually quite helpful and guided me through securing my account and stopping all of the fella’s running items. I am now waiting on the AWS billing team to decide whether or not to refund me that money and give me access to my account again. Hopefully they decide within the next millennia, because this is starting to not be a fun experience.</p>

  <p>“Oh, hello there miss, I bet I can predict the number of rings on the shell of an abalone snail with 26.3% accuracy as long as you provide me with weight of its shell, dried entrails, dried viscera, bled body, and sex!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i> Who ever said computer science couldn’t get you girls? </i>
Ok, let me explain a little. This semester I am taking a class on machine learning. For those who are unaware, the idea behind machine learning is basically that given enough data and powerful enough libraries written by people much smarter than you, you can train an algorithm, or more accurately do a lot of math to make an algorithm that can predict outcomes with really high accuracy. It’s a very powerful tool and I find it extremely interesting, but just like with any other discipline, you have to wade through the muck to get to a point where you are doing anything really fascinating.</p>

<p>Anyway, this week my class got its first assignment where we were supposed to make a neural network (NN) which could predict the age of an abalone snail based off some other criteria. While I must admit, there are things I find more interesting than snails, I won’t pretend like this is not one of the coolest bits of code I have ever written. It’s still a work in progress though, maybe when it gets a little better, or when I do something more interesting, I’ll post my actual code and output, we’ll see.</p>

<h3 id="as-for-the-rest-of-the-week">As for the rest of the week</h3>
<p>It’s going to be a rough weekend. I have to grade 40 exams, write a very legit formal lab report, do an exorbitant amount of Statistical Mechanics work, and study for 2 midterms, but I’m sure there will be tons of time for fun and games in there somewhere (there will not be).</p>

What else is new?</h3>

<p>See ya in the next one</p>
