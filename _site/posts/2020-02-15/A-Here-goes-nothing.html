<p>This is my first blog post. I am currently sitting in the common room of my suite, building this site and simultaneously trying to figure out exactly what I want it to be. I think I am going to go for something similar to what my friend Noah has built. I would link to his site, but then the few people who might be reading this would go over and look at his work which is undeniably better than mine, but I digress.</p>
<h2 id="what-a-week-its-been">What a week it’s been</h2>
<p>The week started out normal, my birthday was on Thursday, so I was excited for that to come. The big <strong>TWO ZERO</strong> as they say, I don’t think anyone says that, but hey it’s my blog so I can say whatever I want. Anyway, come Wednesday I started to feel a little under the weather, but I shook it off and carried on with my schoolwork. I woke up Thursday morning with a mild fever of <strong>100.5</strong> and felt like utter garbage. My whole body hurt, and it was almost impossible to swallow. What a birthday this was going to be. I went to the University Health Center, an organization known for their medical prowess <span style="color:orange;">/s</span> (this is internet short hand indicating sarcasm for those who are unfamiliar). I was eventually diagnosed with</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Influenza-like illness”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and I was given a prescription for Tamiflu, which is ridiculously expensive even if you have good insurance, the life of a college student is fill with monetary trials and tribulations.</p>

<p>So yeah, I was super sick and miserable and was supposed to hold a discussion the next day. I emailed my professor and he said we could find a sub. Fast forward to Friday and no one showed up to hold the discussion. I got a slight reprimand from the professor as apparently it was my responsibility to find a substitute, which I was unaware of. For those keeping score at home it’s now something like 0-1000 against Stefan for this week. Let’s hope there’s some improvement for next week but I won’t hold my breath.</p>

<p>Got super sick on my birthday. Had no Valentine :(. Missed my discussion because I was sick and really screwed up the week. <strong>Great Week!</strong></p>
