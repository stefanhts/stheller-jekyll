# Lots to cover in this one, cuz its been a while
## Let's start with the title: "What do the Coronavirus and web apps have in common?"
The answer is that they're both on my mind. If there's one truth I know to be universal,
it's that Reddit is both the best and the worst place that exists. I spend an amount of time I am not willing
to publicly admit on Reddit. It has everything from top tier memes to top tier conspiracy theories and more. What I recently stumbled on
is the subreddit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus">r/Coronavirus</a> which has all of the most recent news and theories regarding the
novel Coronavirus. It is, to be completely honest, a terrifying but addicting place to be. I have been attached to the page non stop for about a
week now, and I am more aware of the end of times pandemic around us than any of my peers. So yeah, I'm pretty concerned about what will happen in
the U.S. as far as infections and transmission. I'm not scared for myself though, I am worried about my family, specifically a few family members who
are very susceptible to disease. I really hope that we find some way of dealing with this, or that it doesn't get as bad as I think it's going to.
I guess we'll find out...
<br/>
As for the web apps part... After a recent conversation with my roommate, we have come to the decision that we want to build a web app in python, likely
using Django to hone our skills and get some cool experience. The problem is that we don't yet know what we want to build, although I just came up
with and idea and I'm curious what he'll think about it. My idea is to build some sort of Spotify client using the Spotify API. My roommate and I both have
a real passion for music, and I think this could be a really cool project. I think I might try to build something where you upload your playlists and people
can rate and review playlists and maybe there will be some sort of music recommendation page... Idk yet but the idea is growing in my head at the moment.

## In other news...
For my machine learning class we have graduated to something much more interesting than the number of rings on the shell of an abalone snail.
This time we are creating a Convolutional Neural Net (basically it detects patterns, but it's more nuanced than that), which will be able to identify
hand written digits as their correct categorization with ~97% accuracy. I plan to have an entire post on that, which will go into much more detail and
show some of the code I wrote for it.

### Little thing I have noticed recently:
I have gotten so much better at typing, it's wild. Sometimes I put /s instead of 's, but for the most part I put almost no effort into thinking about where
my fingers are going to go and instead think about what I am saying. This might not be a very novel skill for most people, but I'm actually quite impressed with
the progression of my typing skills.

### TL;DR: Coronavirus is scary, I want to build a music web app, machine learning is cool, and I can type like a normal person I guess...

See ya in the next one,
Stefan
