# I did it folks
Somehow I managed to finish my formal lab report, grading all my exams, and it's not even 2am yet. This is what we call a <b><i>success</i></b> story. This was the 1 and only formal lab report of the semester for me, and I think this might have been the busiest I will be all semester. Here's hoping anyway...

So for an update, I still have a midterm, technically tomorrow, in Economics. I have not studyed at all yet and honestly I don't plan to study much, but we've got a strong 32 hours or so, so the world really is my oyster. What a strange saying... 

For the rest of the week I will be working on my 9 problems of Quantum Mechanics homework. A little fun tidbit about this one, our professor informed us that 1 of the problems took him, a Ph.d. professional physicist, over 6 hours to complete. So this is going to be an interesting assignment. We also have our first midterm in the class on Monday and it's going to be a wild ride.

## The unfortunate truth about TAing
Other than the intense anxiety that TAing causes me, it's not the worst gig, for the most part I can choose my own hours, and work as much or as little as I find necessary. I don't get paid a lot, but it's a conviniet job and I'm not mad at that.

This is where the fun stops though. Not only is grading exams tedious and time consuming, it is extremely disheartening and depressing. A friend recommended I share this, because most people don't get to see the other side of teaching. I had to give my first failing grade to a student on an exam tonight. It was one of the worst feelings I have experienced. I wanted so much to be able to converse with the student or find some way to fix their grade and make it a little less severe, but the grading is pretty binary, and it would be unfair to other students if I were to change the grading for an individual student. 

The entire time I was grading that first failing exam I could tell what was going to happen before I actually did the math on their score. I couldn't help but imagine myself being the student recieving that grade. I have been there, and the stomach drop is sickening like almost nothing else I've experienced.

I'm not sure how I'm going to adapt to this reality of having to give really horrible grades to good people. I simultaneously hope and fear that it will become easier in the future. Here's hoping no one in my class ever fails another exam. That would be the happiest outcome for all of us.

### Anyway
This hasn't been a very structured blog. I've kind of just let my stream of conciousness out. I hope this sheds light on what it's like to be the person doing the grading, but I don't know. Events like this leave me unsure of my convictions and I'm going to have to think about this for a while before I know exactly how to feel.

### TL;DR: I finished my work, but there's more obviously. Also grading is hard and boring, but also very disheartening.
