My name is <i>Stefan T. Heller</i> and I like to code.
<br/>
I am a Computer Science and Physics double major at the University of Maryland, College Park

This website serves as a blog, a learning experience, and (at some point soon) a portfolio...

<h3> Where am I now?</h3>

At the time of writing this I am 21 and still working on my 2 degress at the
<a href="https://umd.edu" style="color:red">University of Marlyand, College Park</a>.
I am currently taking classes in Compilers (Using Racket and x86 assembly), Artificial Intelligence, and Data Visualization.
To read more about what's going on with me, head over to my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.

<h3> What are my interests?</h3>
<hr>
<h4><code>Computer Science:</code></h4>

When it comes to Computer Science, I am mainly interested in backend development as well as more applied theory type projects, such as Regex Engines, building programming languages, and Block Chain construction and application. I recently accepted an internship at Okta, where supposedly I will be doing development in Go. So over the past couple weeks I have been honing my Go skills with the intent of making it my #1 language by the time summer roles around.

<h4>Everything Else:</h4>

<p>
When I'm not at my computer I have interests all over the map. Within the last 6 months I got into cycling, unfortunately the weather has not really been cooperating in Maryland for the last couple months, but I look forward to getting back to that. I also recently started doing daily yoga. I started with the <strong>30 day yoga challenge</strong> by <a href="https://youtube.com/yogawithadrienne">Yoga with Adrienne<a> and at the time I'm writing this I am 26 days in.

<p>
In addition to Yoga I have been getting into hiking lately, just generally trying to get outside more, to help with my mental and physical health. I also enjoy cooking, watching movies, and listening to all sorts of music. The pandemic has put a damper on a lot of those things, but with vaccinations and becoming accustomed to doing things virtually, I have been begining to find ways to explore my interests in this new environment. I also spend my fair share of time playing video games with my friends who I am not currently able to see due to various reasons.

<h3> So that's me</h3>
Summed up, I like computers, numbers, music, movies, video games, and different sorts of exercise. And yeah that's all there is to me.

I look forward to seeing you here more often :)
